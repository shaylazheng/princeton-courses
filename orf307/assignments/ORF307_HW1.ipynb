Use the following lines to first factorize the matrix $A$ as $A = PLU$ where $P$ is a permutation matrix, $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is a upper triangular matrix. The idea is that we have $Ax = PLUx = b$.  For convenience we have coded the functions `forward_substitution` and `backward_substitution` for you. A property of any permutation matrix $P$ is that $P^TP = I$.  Use this property to solve the same linear system as in the previous parts and determine how long your computer takes.  Verify that you get the same solution as from parts (a) and (b). \n",
