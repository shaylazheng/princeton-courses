## ORF 307: Optimization _(Fall 2025)_
This course focuses on analytical and computational tools for optimization. We will introduce least squares optimization with multiple objectives and constraints. We will also discuss linear optimization modeling, duality, the simplex method, degeneracy, interior point methods and network flow optimization. Finally, we will cover integer programming and branch-and-bound algorithms. A broad spectrum of real-world applications in engineering, finance and statistics is presented.

## ECO 462: Portfolio Theory and Asset Management _(Fall 2025)_
This course covers a number of advanced topics related to asset management and asset pricing. Topics covered include mean-variance analysis, dynamic optimization, CAPM, APT, market efficiency, active money management, indexing, stock return predictability, bubbles and crashes, mutual fund and professional managers' performance, hedge funds, security analysts, social interaction and investor behavior and fixed income portfolio management.

## ECO 491: Financial Risk Management _(Fall 2025)_
This course offers a comprehensive and modern view of a risk management system. The material studied will be helpful for any future career related to trading, portfolio and risk management. It is a hands-on computational course that mixes theory with practical solutions to issues appearing in financial firms. We primarily cover topics related to market risk including but not limited to risk factors and how they are used to price assets, bonds and options hedging, portfolio conditional loss distributions, back-testing our risk management models, and stress testing.
