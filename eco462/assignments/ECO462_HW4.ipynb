    "portfolio to move one-to-one with HML and not with the other factors?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: A mimicking portfolio for the High-Minus-Low (HML) factor, as defined in the Fama–French factor framework, is constructed by taking long and short positions in portfolios sorted by book-to-market ratios. Specifically, assets are typically grouped into three quantiles (high, medium, and low) based on their book-to-market values. The HML factor is then formed by going long high book-to-market (“value”) stocks and short low book-to-market (“growth”) stocks, generally with equal weights across each leg.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the broader factor-modeling framework, mimicking portfolios are designed to isolate exposure to a single systematic factor. In the first-pass regression, each asset’s factor loadings (betas) are estimated by regressing excess returns on the factor returns. Suppose there are $n$ assets and $k$ factors, yielding a beta matrix $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$. The goal is to find portfolio weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that:\n",
    "$$B^{\\intercal}w = e_j$$\n",
    "where $e_j$ is the unit vector corresponding to the HML factor (or any arbitrary target factor at index $j$), implying the portfolio has beta 1 with respect to HML and 0 with respect to all other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $n>k$ and the column of $B$ are linearly independent, there exists at least one $w$ that satisfies the system, ensuring that the mimicking portfolio's returns move 1-for-1 with HML and are orthogonal to the other factors.The mimicking portfolio is explicitly constructed to neutralize any exposure to all non-HML factors, thus any variation can be solely attributed to the HML factor and therefore does not covary with any other factor."

The alternative hypothesis is that high book-to-market firms earn higher average returns ($H_A:\\mu _{HML} > 0$).\n",

    "Before running the regressions, you need to construct excess returns on each of\n",
    "the five stocks. Interpret the results. Are the factor loadings estimated precisely?\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the precision of the estimated factor loadings from the first-pass Fama-French 3-factor regressions, we perform a one-sample t-test on each coefficient for each stock ($b_i, s_i, h_i$). Formally, the null hypothesis is for each factor loading is:\n",
    "$$H_0:\\beta _{factor}=0$$\n",

    "$$H_A:\\beta _{factor} \\neq 0$$\n",
    "This test evaluates whether the estimated factor loading is statistically distinguishable from zero at a conventional significance level. In the context of factor models, a rejection of the null indicates that the factor contributes meaningfully to explaining the excess return of the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same significance threshold of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the estimated factor loadings for the market (*Beta_MKT*) and size (*Beta_SML*) are statistically significant for all give stocks, indicated by a p-values below 0.05, confirming that these factor exposures are estimated with high precision. For the value factor (*Beta_HML*), however, the factor loading was not statistically significant for BMY ($p=0.19878$), suggesting that its exposure to HML\n",

    "we observe that the estimates for the factor loadings found above in the columns \"Beta_MKT\", \"Beta_SMB\", and \"Beta_HML\" are mostly all precise. Specifically, the resulting p-values for the factor loadings for the MKT factor and the SMB factor are both \"precise\" by being below the as shown by the sigificance of 0.05. However, the \"Beta_HML\" factor is not statistically significant for BMY and perhaps indicates a less precise factor loading. Overall, since a single asset is does not determine the validity of the entire factor model and the factor loadings, the factor can still be considered reasonably precise considering the other p-values for the four other stocks are below the threshold value of 0.05.\n",

For instance, a negative t-statistics indicates that the stocks are short the SMB factor. Additionally, there is a negative t-statistic for some stocks regarding the HML factor, indicating some shorting of the factor. On the other hand, each stock is observed to have a long position in the market."
